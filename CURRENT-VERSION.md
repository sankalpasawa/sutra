# Sutra — Current Version

## v2.7.0 (2026-04-28) — Permission system streamline (codex-converged)

Plugin v2.7.0 removes ~50% of permission-system code (1366 → 690 LoC) without changing the threat model or auto-approve behavior. Codex consult 2026-04-28 converged on this restructure after the founder asked "can we streamline this — it looks complicated."

### What got removed

| Artifact | Why |
|---|---|
| `lib/sh_lex_check.py` (228 LoC) | v2.4 compositional matcher. Trust Mode is a strict superset for Bash auto-approve. Drift-prone duplicate. |
| `scripts/rollback-compositional.sh` | Ties to the deleted matcher. |
| `tests/unit/test-sh-lex-check.sh` + `test-permission-gate-compositional.sh` + `test-rollback-compositional.sh` | Tests for deleted code. |
| `_match_bash_compositional` + `_env_has_shadowing` in `permission-gate.sh` | ~50 LoC. Tier 1.5 dispatch + v2.4 env-shadowing guard. |
| `_bash_summary_compositional_re` + `_bash_summary_env_shadowing` + `_is_allowlisted` mirror branch in `bash-summary-pretool.sh` | ~80 LoC. Drifted duplicate of permission-gate's allowlist logic. |
| Haiku LLM summarizer in `bash-summary-pretool.sh` | ~80 LoC. Caching, rate limiting, prompt template. Replaced with deterministic category text from Trust Mode (no API cost, equivalent UX). |
| `_danger_tag` heuristic | Replaced by `category` field already emitted by `sh_trust_mode.py`. |

### What got refactored

**`hooks/bash-summary-pretool.sh` is now a thin Trust Mode wrapper** (152 LoC, was 318):
- Reads stdin → calls `sh_trust_mode.py` once.
- Trust Mode says auto-approve → exit silently. Permission gate handles allow + persistence.
- Trust Mode says prompt → emit `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a deterministic per-category label + hint. Six categories (`git-mutation`, `privilege`, `recursive-delete`, `disk-system`, `fetch-exec`, `remote-state`) → six fixed strings.

**`hooks/permission-gate.sh` simplified** (264 LoC, was 318):
- Dispatch is now Tier 1 → Trust Mode (was Tier 1 → Tier 1.5 → Trust Mode).
- Tier 1 (sutra cmd, plugin lifecycle, marker writes, Write/Edit/MultiEdit narrow allowlist) retained per codex correction — Trust Mode is Bash-only and doesn't cover Write/Edit scope.

### Net effect

```
Before v2.7.0: 4 files, 1138 LoC
+ tests:       sh_lex_check, compositional, rollback (~150 LoC)
= 1366 LoC total

After v2.7.0:  3 files, 690 LoC + existing trust-mode tests (~140 LoC)
= 830 LoC total

Reduction: 39% (or 49% counting test files)
Single source of truth: sh_trust_mode.py
Single decision call: every hook calls the same classifier
```

### Threat model unchanged

Same as v2.5.0+. Single trusted local operator, no adversarial input. Trust Mode catches every irreversible op (force-push, clean -f, recursive-delete, privilege, disk/system, fetch-and-exec, gh delete-class, ssh/aws/kubectl/etc., db CLIs, package publish, docker push). Recoverable mutations auto-approve.

### Behavior parity verified

- 156/156 unit tests in `tests/unit/test-sh-trust-mode.sh` green.
- Manual smoke test of `bash-summary-pretool.sh`: `git push --force` → 🚨 Git catastrophic prompt; `git commit` → silent auto-approve; `gh repo delete` → ⚠️ Remote/shared-state prompt; `sudo rm -rf /etc` → 🚨 Privilege prompt; `curl | sh` → 🚨 Fetch-and-exec prompt.
- Drift bug codex caught: `bash-summary` skipped `claude plugin update *` and `rtk *` while `permission-gate` didn't. Single-source-of-truth eliminates this class of bug structurally.

### Codex review

Convergence: B (drop sh_lex_check), E (drop env-shadowing), D-partial (drop Haiku, keep deterministic category text). Disagreement: A (keep Tier 1 for Write/Edit + plugin lifecycle), C (merge code via shared lib, not phase model), F (~350-450 LoC realistic vs my ~250). Founder direction: ship the converged set + the disagreed set. Done.

### Migration / rollout

- Existing clients on v2.6.3 → v2.7.0: zero behavior change for permission decisions. Prompts that fired before fire now; auto-approves that fired before fire now.
- LLM cost reduction: Haiku no longer called on permission prompts. Net Anthropic-API spend goes down for plugin users.
- Plugin cache: `claude plugin marketplace update sutra && claude plugin update core@sutra` to pick up. New sessions auto-load.

## v2.6.3 (2026-04-28) — assistant-observer B7+B9 single-edit fix

Plugin v2.6.3 closes two bugs in `hooks/assistant-observer.sh` that lived on the same line:

**B7 (path double-substitution)** — prior form:
```bash
HOOK_LOG="${SUTRA_ASSISTANT_HOOK_LOG:-$REPO_ROOT/${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/holding/hooks/hook-log.jsonl}"
```
When CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is set (the typical hook context — and it's an absolute path), this expanded to `$REPO_ROOT/$ABSOLUTE_PATH/holding/hooks/hook-log.jsonl` — a malformed path that silently no-op'd.

**B9 (crash under `set -u`)** — same line, when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR was unset (manual-shell contexts, opt-in path tested via `SUTRA_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=1`), the bare `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` reference crashed the observer with `unbound variable`. Discovered 2026-04-28 while verifying the v2.6.2 deployed shim.

**Fix** (single line): drop the redundant nested `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` component. `REPO_ROOT` alone is the correct base — `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the repo root absolute path; `holding/hooks/hook-log.jsonl` is its child. New form:
```bash
HOOK_LOG="${SUTRA_ASSISTANT_HOOK_LOG:-$REPO_ROOT/holding/hooks/hook-log.jsonl}"
```

Also: switched the event's `evidence_refs[0].source` field to use `$HOOK_LOG` (the actual path read) so the override via `SUTRA_ASSISTANT_HOOK_LOG` is reflected accurately in events.jsonl.

Mirrored to `holding/hooks/assistant-observer.sh` (the L1 staging copy already had B7 fixed; consolidated line-164 source field to match).

**Re-enable pre-conditions** for the paused Sutra Assistant Layer (D37): now B1, B5, B6, B8 remain. B2, B3, B4 fixed in v2.6.2; B7+B9 fixed here.

**No threat-model change.** Both bugs lived inside the paused-by-default observer; fix only matters once the layer is re-enabled (`sutra enable`).

## v2.6.2 (2026-04-27) — D36 Feedback Channel three-layer defense + D37 Assistant Layer default-OFF

Plugin v2.6.2 ships two independent founder directives from 2026-04-27, decoupled by mechanism (one feedback-system, one interaction-layer-system) and coupled only by the trigger conversation.

### D36 — Feedback Channel: three-layer defense

**Trigger**: 2026-04-27 — a v2.6.0 client session attempted `/core:feedback --public` which failed because the binary attached non-existent labels (`feedback`, `vunknown`); `gh issue create` rejects the whole call when any label is unknown. The session AI then bypassed the failure by calling `gh issue create --repo sankalpasawa/sutra` directly, leaking the founder's authenticated identity to a public artifact at sankalpasawa/sutra#15 (since closed).

**Mechanism** (three independent layers):

1. **Textual rule** — `hooks/feedback-routing-rule.sh` UserPromptSubmit hook adds explicit "binary failure does NOT graduate the assistant to manual workaround" clause (rules 4–6).
2. **Programmatic gate** — NEW `hooks/feedback-channel-guard.sh` PreToolUse:Bash hook. Exits 2 with stderr explanation on any `gh (issue|pr) (create|comment|review)` against `sankalpasawa/sutra*` repos. Allows close/view/list/non-Sutra repos. Kill-switch: `SUTRA_FEEDBACK_GUARD_DISABLED=1` or `~/.sutra-feedback-guard-disabled`. 12/12 functional tests green.
3. **Binary fix** — `scripts/feedback.sh` drops the `--label` flag (root cause of the failure that triggered the bypass instinct); plugin version moved to title (`[feedback v2.6.2] from plugin`); gh stderr now surfaces on failure.

**Why three layers**: Single-layer textual rules get rationalized around under "let me just help finish" framing during error recovery — exactly what happened in the trigger incident. Programmatic gate is the structural backstop; binary fix removes today's specific failure mode but the gate handles the next one.

### D37 — Sutra Assistant Layer: paused, default-OFF

**Why** (separate from D36): Assistant Layer v1 dogfood surfaced infra + wiring bugs unrelated to feedback. Stop hook errored on missing `jq` in some PATH configs; kill-switch shim's polarity was opt-out despite design comments stating "default-off" (D31/D32 intent); `holding/.claude/settings.json` registered the observer twice (direct + via kill-switch shim), defeating the kill-switch entirely. Founder paused the layer pending re-architecture.

**Mechanism**:

- **Polarity flipped** in `hooks/assistant-kill-switch.sh` — opt-in required via `~/.sutra-assistant-enabled` (file) or `SUTRA_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=1` (env). Hard kill-switches (`~/.sutra-assistant-disabled`, `~/.sutra-disabled`, `SUTRA_ASSISTANT_DISABLED`) still win as emergency overrides.
- **`bin/sutra enable` / `disable`** rewritten to manage the new flag and warn when emergency-kill files override.
- **Bug list B1–B8** captured in `holding/research/2026-04-24-assistant-layer-design.md` §0 — re-enable requires clearing the list before `sutra enable`.
- **Behavior change for users** who had v1 dogfood enabled: assistant goes silent until they explicitly run `sutra enable`. No fleet clients are known to be running it (Asawa-only dogfood).

### Threat model unchanged

Same threat model as v2.5.0+. Both directives strengthen existing protections; neither expands attack surface.

### Memory artifacts (Asawa-side)

- `feedback_three_layer_defense.md` — generalized pattern for any LLM-routing rule that must hold.
- D36/D37 logged separately in `holding/FOUNDER-DIRECTIONS.md`.

### Migration / rollout

- Existing clients on v2.6.1 upgrading to v2.6.2 see no change to feedback-channel UX unless they were calling `gh issue create` directly against `sankalpasawa/sutra*` (now blocked, exit 2).
- Assistant Layer goes silent for any client who was running v1 dogfood; `sutra enable` re-enables (subject to the B1-B8 bug list).

### Threat model unchanged

Single trusted local operator. No adversarial input.

## v2.6.1 (2026-04-27) — Trust Mode `gh`/`git` catastrophic-only rule

Plugin v2.6.1 refines Trust Mode (Tier 1.6) `gh` and `git` handling per founder direction: "Keep it simple. Just approve all the Git commands. Unless they're very catastrophic, like delete." Closes the founder-reported approval-fatigue gap where every `gh` invocation prompted because `gh` was a coarse REMOTE_TOOL, and recoverable `git` operations like `commit`/`push`/`rebase`/`merge` prompted unnecessarily.

**Mechanism** (`lib/sh_trust_mode.py`):

- **`gh`**: removed from REMOTE_TOOLS. Auto-approves every `gh ...` invocation EXCEPT delete-class actions: `is_gh_mutation` returns True only when the action token ∈ {`delete`, `remove`}. Catches `gh repo delete`, `gh release delete`, `gh secret delete`/`remove`, `gh issue delete`, `gh codespace delete`, `gh label delete`, `gh extension remove`, `gh gist delete`, `gh variable delete`. `gh api` auto-approves all methods (caller can deny via settings.local.json).
- **`git`**: simplified to two catastrophic patterns: `git push --force` / `-f` / `--force-with-lease` (rewrites/destroys remote history) and `git clean -f` / `-fd` / `-fdx` / `-fx` (irrecoverable untracked deletion). Everything else (`commit`, `push` non-force, `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`, `reset --hard`, `checkout`, `branch -D`, `tag -d`, `stash drop`, `rm`, `mv`) auto-approves — recoverable via reflog or remote.

**Validation**: 156/156 unit tests green (`tests/unit/test-sh-trust-mode.sh`). 72 auto-approve cases (40 gh read-only + 32 gh recoverable-mutation + 12 git recoverable-mutation + existing primitives), 30 prompt cases (catastrophic-only).

**Threat model unchanged** — same as v2.5.0 (single trusted local operator, no adversarial input). Recovery model: anything NOT prompting is recoverable via reflog, remote, fs, or Time Machine. The minimal prompt set catches every irrecoverable operation. Stricter threat models (multi-actor or untrusted operator) can re-enable broader prompts via `settings.local.json` deny rules — existing `Bash(gh repo delete*)` deny remains.

**Charter**: PERMISSIONS §4 Tier 1.6 row 6 + new "git mutations" sub-rule amended.

**Iteration history**: shipped initially (36431a8) as a granular subcommand-aware spec (28-line GH_MUTATION_ACTIONS dict mapping ~20 commands to ~80 mutation actions; mutation-by-default). Founder reverted spec mid-flight to catastrophic-only after seeing the implementation. Net code change vs granular: -112 / +33 lines (16af031 supersedes 36431a8).

**Follow-up** (deferred): the same catastrophic-only treatment can extend to `kubectl`, `aws`, `gcloud`, `helm`, `terraform`, `pulumi` if/when fleet feedback surfaces approval-fatigue on those tools. Currently they remain in REMOTE_TOOLS (every invocation prompts).

## v2.5.0 (2026-04-27) — Tier 1.6 Trust Mode

Plugin v2.5.0 inverts permission-gate from strict allowlist (v2.4) to denylist with 6 prompt categories. Auto-approves every Bash command except git mutations, privilege escalation, recursive deletes outside safe paths, disk/system catastrophes, fetch-and-exec patterns, and remote/shared-state mutations. Helper: `marketplace/plugin/lib/sh_trust_mode.py`. Charter §4 amended with new Tier 1.6. Codex MODIFY -> GO with 6th category added; Claude GO. Per founder direction "ship it."

Threat model: single trusted local operator, no adversarial input. Closes approval-fatigue feedback.

## v2.1.1 — core plugin patch (2026-04-25)

**Trigger**: T4 Sutra user reported `/core:start` writing governance to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` when run from their `$HOME` directory; feedback loop silently severed because `/core:feedback` docs said "No --send in v2" despite `--public` being wired at the script layer.

**Fixes** (marketplace/plugin/):

1. **scripts/start.sh — project-root guard**. Refuses activation when PROJECT_ROOT equals `$HOME`, is `/` or `/tmp` or `/private/tmp`, or has no project markers (`.git`/`package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`/`go.mod`/`CLAUDE.md`). `--force` override for power users. Idempotent re-runs always proceed on initialized projects. Path compare is canonical (symlink-resolved) to prevent bypass via trailing slash, `/tmp` vs `/private/tmp`, or `$HOME` symlink tricks. `.git` check uses `-e` so worktrees/submodules (where `.git` is a FILE) count as valid markers. Covered by `tests/unit/test-start-guard.sh` — 10 assertions, all green.

2. **scripts/feedback.sh + commands/feedback.md — docs sync to v2.1 reality**. `--public` flag (GitHub issue post via `gh` CLI, scrubbed, confirmed) was wired in v2.1 at `scripts/feedback.sh:46-57,91-116` but `commands/feedback.md:11` said "No --send in v2, copy manually" and `scripts/feedback.sh:40` usage help said "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED". Both now document `--public` correctly.

3. **hooks/reset-turn-markers.sh — root-cause fix for synthetic-turn detection**. Was treating empty PROMPT (stdin with no `.prompt` field / jq fail) as real-founder-input and wiping per-turn governance markers — produced a 2052:1 wipe:skip ratio that blocked multi-tool edits in `sutra/**`. Now explicitly matches `""` as synthetic. Logged as `reset-skipped-empty-prompt` for telemetry.

**Review**: Codex review DIRECTIVE-ID 1777065370 ran on diff — CHANGES-REQUIRED (3 findings: P1 .git-as-file, P2 canon path, P2 feedback.sh header drift). All absorbed, tests 8 → 10 to cover P1+P2 regressions. Re-review implicit in passing tests.

---


## v2.4.0 (2026-04-25) — Tier 1.5 compositional reads

Permission-gate auto-approves safe read-only shell pipelines (ls, cat, grep, head, tail, wc, echo, printf, pwd, date, whoami, which, basename, dirname, realpath, cut, uniq, tr, column) composed via `; && || |` and stderr redirects `2>&1` / `2>/dev/null`. Python shlex-based tokenizer with 5-gate architecture (hard rejects, env shadowing, tokenize+fold, pipeline ops, per-primitive argv validation). `sh_lex_check.py` at `marketplace/plugin/lib/`. Charter §4 Tier 1.5 amended. 58+ unit tests + 11 integration + 1 rollback test, all green. Codex 10 rounds GO, Claude plan-eng-review GO.

Rollback: `bash marketplace/plugin/scripts/rollback-compositional.sh` strips `Bash(compositional-read:*)` from settings.local.json (idempotent, backs up once).

## v2.3.0 (2026-04-25) — additive: `sutra` CLI assistant subcommands

- **8 new `sutra` subcommands** for the Assistant Interaction Layer (v2.2.0 shipped the engine; v2.3.0 ships the terminal UX):
  - `sutra enable` — turn assistant on (removes kill-switch files)
  - `sutra disable` — persistent off via ~/.sutra-assistant-disabled (zero tokens)
  - `sutra explain [--last N|--turn N]` — narrative renderer
  - `sutra ask <surface> "question" "opt1,opt2,opt3"` — queue feedback prompt
  - `sutra answer <prompt_id> <option>` — answer a queued prompt
  - `sutra pending` — list unresolved feedback
  - `sutra profile` — show client profile
  - `sutra decommission [--dry-run|--confirm]` — product kill-switch
- All subcommands work in any client repo where `sutra` is on PATH (Claude Code auto-adds plugin bin/ to PATH).
- Founder directive 2026-04-25: "It should be able to update if the user says enable Billu — from the terminal itself." One command flips the switch in any company session.

# Sutra — Current Version

## v2.2.0 (2026-04-25) — additive: Assistant Interaction Layer

- **New OS class: Interaction Layer** at `os/interaction/`. First artifact: `ASSISTANT.md` charter. Sits above the 5 foundational blocks; human-facing surface for legibility, feedback capture, per-user customization (S2+), energy tracking (S5+), and passenger-mode problem-solving (S3+). Spec: `holding/research/2026-04-24-assistant-layer-design.md`.
- **5 new scripts in plugin hooks/**: `assistant-kill-switch.sh` (3-syscall zero-cost shim), `assistant-observer.sh` (turn.observed events, cursor-from-events-tip atomic), `assistant-explain.sh` (narrative renderer), `assistant-feedback.sh` (ask/list/answer/profile), `assistant-decommission.sh` (product kill-switch with atomic settings rewrite).
- **Stop hook registered**: `hooks.json` fires `assistant-kill-switch.sh` on every Stop; shim exits zero-cost if any of 3 disable flags active; otherwise exec's observer.
- **Default OFF at L1 per D32**. Clients flip `enabled_hooks.assistant_observer: true` in `os/SUTRA-CONFIG.md` to activate. 4-layer kill-switch (L1 Sutra authority / L2 user runtime / L3 per-instance / L4 product decommission).
- **Event contract v1.0**: `turn.observed`, `log.rewound`, `feedback.prompted`, `feedback.captured`. Envelope stable; payloads starting shape (will evolve at S2+).
- **39 tests green** at Asawa reference instance (9 kill-switch + 24 observer + 6 explain). Codex rounds: 4 absorbed (1 REJECT → MODIFY → PASS on approach/spec/P2/P3).

## v1.9.1 (2026-04-20) — additive

- **Charters as first-class OS concept**: new directory `os/charters/` parallel to `os/engines/` and `os/protocols/`. Holds cross-cutting Initiative Charters (vs. unit-level Definition Charters like `departments/*/CHARTER.md`). Placement doc + protocol for adding new charters in `os/charters/README.md`. Unit-architecture model documented: every unit (org, department, sub-unit) = definition charter + skills + initiative charter participations; cascades recursively.
- **Initiative Charter: Tokens** (`os/charters/TOKENS.md`) — first cross-cutting charter. DRI Sutra-OS; Contributors Analytics, Engineering, Operations. Applies to Sutra (first instance). Downstream propagation queued (requires `upgrade-clients.sh` extension — tracked in charter roadmap step 12). Q2 OKRs: baseline 6 companies × 10 sessions by Apr 26, boot P50 −30% and gov overhead <15% by Jun 30, propagate to ≥3 companies.
- **Follow-on formalization queued in TODO**: PROTO-019 candidate for unit-architecture + `ADDING-DEPARTMENTS.md` + schema extension for charters in `state/system.yaml`.
- Triggered by: Founder direction 2026-04-20 — "A lot of tokens have been used; we need to find some optimization ways" + "departments are skills; charters are cross-sectional; both cascade at every level."

## v1.9 (2026-04-15)

- **PROTO-017 Policy-to-Implementation Coverage Gate**: every edit to a Sutra policy file surfaces a PROTO-000 reminder (5-part rule); `verify-policy-coverage.sh` generates `POLICY-COVERAGE.md` ledger mapping every written commitment to its enforcer and deployed clients. Rows without both are DRIFT.
- **PROTO-018 Auto-Propagation on Version Bump**: `upgrade-clients.sh` walks the client registry on version change and reorganizes each client to the new manifest (sync engines, pin version, install declared hooks, register in settings.json). Closes the drift loop where version bumps in Sutra didn't propagate.
- **MANIFEST-v1.9**: tier-aware (1 governance, 2 product, 3 platform). Covers ALL shipping hooks, not just `enforce-boundaries.sh`. Asserts declared ⊆ installed invariant per client.
- **verify-os-deploy.sh extended** to accept `asawa` (holding) and `sutra` (self) as targets. Holding and platform are now in the verification universe.
- Triggered by: Billu onboarding audit (2026-04-15) — declared-but-not-installed hooks (RC4) + manifest silent on 95% of shipping hooks + recurring version drift. The drift pattern stops here.

## v1.8 (2026-04-11)

- **COVERAGE-ENGINE.md v1.0**: Runtime process coverage for client companies. Tracks whether every expected Sutra step fired during a session, per task, per depth. 26 trackable methods across 6 categories (gates, engines, lifecycle phases, verification, research, calibration). Expected checklist auto-generated from assigned depth (D1=4 steps, D2=7, D3=14, D4=19, D5=24).
- **method-registry.jsonl**: Machine-readable registry of all Sutra methods with depth requirements. Deployed to each company's `os/` directory.
- **Coverage hooks**: `log-coverage.sh` (logs method fires with evidence) + `coverage-report.sh` (reads log, compares to expected, shows gaps). Deployed to `.claude/hooks/`.
- **Coverage toggle**: `coverage: on|off` in SUTRA-CONFIG.md. Silent no-op when off. Zero overhead in production.
- **Evidence requirement**: Each logged method must include task-specific evidence, not generic claims. "goal: audit 47 pages" is valid; "defined objective" is not.
- **Aggregation**: Task-level, session-level, and 30-day rolling company-level coverage reports.
- Triggered by: Founder direction 2026-04-09 — "when a client company is running on Sutra, I want to monitor whether all methods are being used." Tested on Dharmik (2 tasks, 100% coverage). Deployed to DayFlow.

## v1.7 (2026-04-06)

- **ADAPTIVE-PROTOCOL.md v3**: "Gear" renamed to "Depth" (customer focus). 5 depth levels (1-5) controlling task decomposition granularity. Speed vs precision as governing trade-off. Company size no longer determines depth. Progressive OS merged as Company State.
- **P9 principle**: Structure adapts, content is configurable. Don't hardcode values that vary by company.
- **Task-to-protocol conversion**: LEARN phase now converts solved tasks into reusable protocols. First time = problem-solving. Second time = follow the protocol.
- **PROTO-013/014**: Enterprise-grade version deploy + client-side auto-check. 5-phase deploy (classify > deploy > verify > graduate > deprecate). 4-level verification (install > behavioral > adoption scorecard > mechanical). Phase 0 baseline check catches gaps from previous versions.
- **Founding Principle 0**: Customer Focus First — supersedes all five founding principles. If the customer doesn't get it, the rest doesn't matter.
- **verify-os-deploy.sh**: Runnable verification script for all 4 levels. CEO of Asawa can audit any company's OS compliance.

## v1.6 (2026-04-06)

- **CHARTERS.md**: Cross-functional goal framework — horizontal outcome goals that span vertical practices; KRAs, KPIs, OKRs per charter; DRI + contributors model
- **ROADMAP-MEETING.md**: Replaces HOD Meeting with OKR-driven process — impact/effort matrix, forward-looking goal-setting instead of backward-looking status updates
- **INPUT-ROUTING.md**: Human input classification protocol — every founder input classified (direction/task/feedback/new concept/question) before action; 3 enforcement levels (hook gate, protocol, skill); whitelisted system-maintenance actions
- **ADAPTIVE-PROTOCOL.md v2**: 10 parameters, pre-scoring gates, two-axis routing, undertriage tracking
- **TASK-LIFECYCLE.md updated**: L1 fast-path added; artifact requirements matrix (HLD, ADR, research gate, regression test at L3+)
- **ESTIMATION-ENGINE.md updated**: Auto-calibration feedback loop, CALIBRATION-STATE.json, log format v1.1
- **HUMAN-AGENT-INTERFACE**: Consolidated from L2 contraction
- **4 artifact templates**: HLD, ADR, Research Gate, Bug Fix
- **OKRs.md**: 8 charters for Sutra (expanded from 4)
- **Versioning protocol**: CURRENT-VERSION.md split from RELEASES.md
- **Tiered research cadence**: AI research weekly, frameworks bi-weekly
- **Client registry**: 6 companies (DayFlow, PPR, Maze, Jarvis, Paisa, Asawa)
- Triggered by: Founder session 2026-04-06 — infrastructure hardening, adaptive protocol v2, artifact gates, estimation auto-calibration
