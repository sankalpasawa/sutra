/**
 * TenantIsolation — M9 Group FF (T-151).
 *
 * Runtime engine that enforces cross-tenant operation safety per D1 P-B8 +
 * D4 §3 (the F-6 forbidden coupling). The engine is a READ-ONLY accessor of
 * the existing `delegates_to: Tenant→Tenant` typed edges already shipped in
 * `src/types/edges.ts` (and already consumed by `l4-terminal-check.ts`
 * `f6Predicate` at lines 481/494/637 — see codex M9 pre-dispatch P1.2 fold).
 *
 * Why an engine and not just a predicate:
 * - L4 terminal-check `f6Predicate` runs at TERMINAL-CHECK time (after a
 *   Workflow has already executed end-to-end) — too late to abort an
 *   in-flight cross-tenant step. The runtime needs an enforcement point at
 *   STEP-DISPATCH time so a violating step never runs.
 * - The step-graph-executor (M5) calls `assertCrossTenantAllowed` from
 *   inside the per-step loop (M9 T-153 wiring). When the source tenant
 *   differs from the target tenant AND no `delegates_to` edge grants the
 *   operation, the call THROWS `CrossTenantBoundaryError`. The executor
 *   catches the throw and synthesizes a step failure with errMsg
 *   `cross_tenant_boundary:<source>->>:<target>:<operation>` so M5
 *   failure-policy routes the violation through the same 5-set
 *   (rollback / escalate / pause / abort / continue) as any other step
 *   failure.
 *
 * Why runtime-DERIVED, not annotation-driven (codex M9 re-review P1 fold):
 * - The previous proposal had a `WorkflowStep.crosses_tenant?: boolean`
 *   advisory hint; producers could omit it and skip enforcement. That was
 *   a bypass loophole. The fix: cross-tenant detection is RUNTIME-DERIVED
 *   in step-graph-executor by comparing `Execution.tenant_context.tenant_id`
 *   against each step's resolved tenant. There is NO opt-out flag.
 *
 * Why no new schema (codex M9 pre-dispatch P1.2 fold):
 * - D4 already defines `delegates_to: Tenant→Tenant` as a typed edge
 *   (src/types/edges.ts:71-83). The engine reads those edges; it does NOT
 *   define a parallel `TenantDelegation` shape. Forking the composition
 *   model right before GA was the explicit codex rejection.
 *
 * Spec source:
 *   - holding/plans/native-v1.0/M9-e2e-vinit.md Group FF T-150..T-155
 *   - .enforcement/codex-reviews/2026-04-30-m9-pre-dispatch.md P1.2 + re-review P1
