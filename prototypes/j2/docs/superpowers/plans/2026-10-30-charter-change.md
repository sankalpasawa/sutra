# Charter Change Implementation Plan (version 2)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or
> superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** A second prompt on a realization website run is split into intents; the judge decides each intent once,
with confidence (A existing, B one fix, C new workflow, D new stage); planning docs change first; then check, build,
Relay and audit.

**Architecture:** Pure logic and the change planner in a new module `j2_change.py` (no import of `j2`).
`j2_realization.py` gets small backward-compatible options (`items=`, `names=`, `only=`, G0, `placement_task`).
`j2.py` gets one handoff kind `change` that reuses the `_realization_plan` hand-off pattern.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.14, J2 (`j2.py`, `j2_realization.py`, `llm.ask` with per-call `mock`), `STUDIO_MOCK=1`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-30-charter-change-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Branch `charter-change`, stacked on `identity-atomic-items` (the Identity one-outcome-per-item rule, 94bffd0 +
  47d8ea7), which sits on `origin/main` bdd8602. Do not push `change-relay`.
- Windows: run Python with `PYTHONUTF8=1`. Commit as `fo <fo@testlify.com>` (`git -c user.name=fo -c user.email=fo@testlify.com`).
- Baseline (30 Oct): `python realization_test.py` 76 checks pass. `python j2_flow_test.py --fast` stops at an existing
  assertion about `site/shots/v4.png` records, on main too; run the relevant flow tests by name instead
  (`import j2_flow_test as t; t.<name>()`), and always `plain_unchanged` (3 calls, see `j2_flow_test.py` ~L8926).
- On only for realization website runs with `J2_CHANGE=1`. A run without a change behaves exactly as today; first-plan
  judge scores do not change.
- No stage, document or workflow name in code or prompts (extend `realization_test.py` "no scenario" checks).
- Item ids are charter numbers, never `done_when` positions.
- Every LLM step has a mock and a malformed-reply path; a malformed reply never means "no change".
- `python realization_test.py` and `python change_test.py` pass; `python j2_flow_test.py --fast` has no new failures.
- Never commit `docs/tax-comparison/` or `runs-broken/`.

## Review Focus

1. Richer come-back features: size fails → C straight away; no revise call is made (count calls).
2. Teach techniques: B makes exactly one revise call; on a second failure the intent goes to C, not another round.
3. Daily Challenge: three intents decided independently; merged plan passes `plan_faults(items=)`.
4. Remove save and resume: Save dropped; Technical design revised before Reasons to come back.
5. Revert of a rename diffs to nothing against the last full plan; no judge call.

---

### Task 0: Branch and baseline

- [ ] `git fetch origin && git switch -c charter-change origin/main`
- [ ] Copy spec and plan into `docs/superpowers/`; record existing failures of `j2_flow_test.py --fast` here.
- [ ] Commit "Charter change v2: spec and plan".

### Task 1: Port Relay's graph logic (code)

**Files:** create `j2_change.py`, `change_test.py` (`ok()` style and env setup of `realization_test.py:1-30`).
Source: `J2_Relay/j2_relay.py:13-197`, tests `J2_Relay/relay_test.py:52-133`.

- `planning_nodes(workflows, is_doc)`, `relay_waves(nodes)`, `direct_readers(workflows, root)`,
  `build_candidates(workflows, roots, is_doc)`, `latest(workflows, root)`, `parse_affected(text)`.
  `is_doc` is passed in (j2 passes `is_artifact`) instead of the hard-coded `index.html`.

- [x] Port the Task 1–2 tests (graph, replies) failing → port code → pass → commit.

### Task 2: Intents and owners (code)

- `charter_diff(base, new) -> {"added": [n], "removed": [n], "rules": {"added","removed"}, "standards": {...},
  "goal_changed": bool}` on charter numbers (`charter_items` index + 1, active = text still in `done_when`).
  `goal_changed` = `statement` or `audience` differs.
- `diff_empty(d) -> bool`; `owner_index(workflows) -> {n: wf_id}` (latest revision, dropped excluded).

```python
d = ch.charter_diff(SUDOKU, renamed)          # item 3 text edited
ok(d["removed"] == [3] and d["added"] == [11], "an edit is remove + add")
ok(ch.diff_empty(ch.charter_diff(SUDOKU, reverted)), "a revert diffs to nothing")
ok(ch.charter_diff(SUDOKU, killer)["goal_changed"], "audience change → re-plan")
ok(ch.owner_index(SUDOKU_WFS)[2] == "W-15", "a revision replaces its original as owner")
```
- [x] Failing tests → implement → pass → commit.

### Task 3: The decision rule (code)

- `decide(kind, match, score) -> "A"|"B"|"C"|"D"` with `match = {"owner": name|None, "stage": id|None}`,
  `score = {"score", "weakest_part"}` and `after_fix` for the second look:
  removed → A; no owner and a plan stage → C; no owner, no stage → D; score ≥ 0.80 → A; weakest_part == "size" → C;
  else B; B re-judged ≥ 0.80 → A, else C.
- `PART = {"done_test": "goal", "inputs": "context", "method": "how", "zone_fit": "how", "factors": "constraints",
  "size": "size", "fits": "goal"}` and `weakest_part(settled)`.

- [x] Tests: one per rule row; the four judge-today presets (0.95 → A, 0.77 how → B, 0.70 context → B, 0.62 size →
      C); `after_fix` 0.79 → C. Commit.

### Task 4: Judge for a change (LLM, mock first)

**Files:** `j2_realization.py`, `agents/j2/confidence-judge.md`, `change_test.py`.

- `checklist_task(goal, items=None)`, `checklist_items(r, goal, items=None)`: questions only for `items`
  (charter numbers).
- `question_spec(p, checklist, names=None)` and `Session.judge(..., names=None)`: only the named workflows.
- `CHECKS` gains `fits`; `QUESTIONS` stays; `CHANGE_QUESTIONS = (("G0", "fits", 0.25, "..."),)` added only by the
  change path.
- `match_task(goal, plan, intents)` + `MATCH_FMT = {"intents": [{"item": n, "owner": str|null, "stage": str|null,
  "why": str}]}`: G0 for every workflow in one call, with the stage question when no one owns it. Malformed twice →
  the intent is decided C (placement looks at it); it is never dropped.

- [x] Tests: subset spec has only named workflows; first-plan spec keys and scores unchanged (Sudoku fixture
      snapshot); mock match gives owner/stage; G0 "no" caps the score. Commit.
- Note: `confidence-judge.md` is left unchanged so the first-plan judge system prompt stays byte-identical; G0 is
  explained in `judge_task`'s CHANGE note. Phase A follow-ups folded in: `weakest_part(settled, spec)` sums by part;
  `owner_index` skips revisions with empty covers.

### Task 5: Act — A, B, C/D (LLM, mock first)

- A: `edit_task(goal, plan, owner, intents)` — scoped revise; workflow with empty delivers and informs is dropped.
- B: `revise_task(goal, web, plan, low, extra, only=[owner])`, one round, then `Session.judge(names=[owner])`.
- C/D: `placement_task(goal, plan, items)` + `PLACE_FMT` (new factors, new stages, new workflows, certainty for the
  new items). Stage ids from `stages.json`; a new stage must hold a planning (decide) workflow, and every new
  workflow lists its stage's planning workflow in `inputs_from`. Merge, `plan_faults(merged, goal, items=active)`,
  one retry with faults named.

- [x] Tests: A remove drops Save; B makes one revise call and then routes C on failure; placement of "Share result"
      adds stage `growth` with a planning workflow; unknown stage `social` → retry. Commit.
- Notes: a planning workflow is a decide workflow that reads no workflow of its own stage (a build-stage decide
  workflow such as written help is not one); in a stage without one (build), a new workflow reads any planning
  workflow of the plan. The edit reply names its `docs` (planning workflows to revise first), so an A intent stays
  within match, score and edit. A removed item whose owner is left with nothing is dropped in code, with no call.
  B's revise reply that is unreadable is a failed fix (→ C), never a second revise call.

### Task 6: plan_change orchestrator (steps 2–6)

- `plan_change(base_goal, new_goal, plan, workflows, mocks=None, log=print, out_dir=None) -> record`
  `record = {"diff", "intents": [{"item", "kind", "owner", "decision", "score", "why"}], "plan", "revise": [...],
  "new": [...], "drop": [...], "docs": [...], "replan": bool, "calls", "seconds"}`.
- docs = planning workflows in `inputs_from` of revised or new workflows, plus new stages' planning workflows.
- Check: judge changed + new; `plan_faults`; failure after one retry → `replan=True`.

- [x] Tests: the 11 Sudoku prompts as scripted mock scenarios; assert decision per intent, `docs`, `replan` and call
      counts (A intent ≤ 3 calls; size → C makes no revise call). Commit.
- Notes: step 6 judges the new workflows only; an A owner was already scored with its items at step 3 and a B owner
  after its fix, so A stays within 3 calls. K questions on the change path are the one-per-item fallback (no checklist
  call). A rule or standard change with no item change is a full re-plan (`replan`). `record` adds `final`,
  `weakest_part`, `stage` per intent and `faults`; `plan_change` takes `web=False` (j2 plans with web off).
- Revised 30 Oct after the live test (six real charters against the real Sudoku plan): owners were scored before
  their edit, so nearly every intent went to B; `fix()` asked for the whole plan back and crashed when the judge's
  reply lacked the owner; step 6 re-placed instead of repairing; a C item got a new stage. Now step 3 is the match
  call only (owner, `too_big`, stage); the owner is edited (one call, only that workflow), then judged; below the gate
  one `improve()` call (only that workflow, given the judge's notes) and a second judgement: pass → final B, else C;
  size → C. Any reply lacking the expected workflow → C with a note (`judged()` drops a name the judge didn't answer).
  Placement gets each item's route; `placement_faults(routes=)` keeps C in plan stages and D in a new stage. Step 6
  gives new workflows below the gate one `improve()` call, then a second judgement, then re-plan. Intents record
  `path`, `score`, `after_fix`, `final`; `summary(rec)` is the one-line text j2 posts. `fix()` and `web=` are gone;
  `revise_task(only=)` stays but is unused.
- Revised again after the re-check of 87cf06d (B worked; D was never chosen; one weak workflow re-planned the whole
  change): with no owner, the match call names the stage from the full stage table whose thinking must decide the
  item (a making stage only when the plan's docs already decide everything); code sets `stage_in_plan` (C) or not
  (D), and placement is told the stage id (`placement_faults(stages=)` keeps a D item in it). After the step-6
  repair a workflow still below 0.80 is held (`R.holds`: it and whatever reads it), its items go in `left_out` with
  the judge's notes, and the change goes on; `replan` is only for plan rule faults. j2 hands Adaptation the left-out
  items (LEAVE OUT, as `_realization_plan`) and tells the Requester which items wait and why.

### Task 7: Into the run

**Files:** `j2.py`.

- [x] `_change_applies()`: `J2_CHANGE=1`, realization website run, `realization.json` present, `self.feedback`.
- [x] After `_identity_intake` saves the new charter: keep `goal.v<k>.json`; no diff → no plan change; `goal_changed`
      → full re-plan (`_realization_applies` allowed once); else handoff `change` → `_turn_change(h)` calls
      `plan_change`, saves `change.json`, posts a one-line summary, and hands Adaptation fixed text (doc revisions
      first, then `revises` and new workflows), like `_realization_plan` :5421.
- [x] Validator while a change is open: a workflow not in the change plan is refused.
- [x] Mock run: "Rename the levels" registers the Product plan revision before the Levels revision, nothing else.
- [x] Commit.
- Notes: the base for every change is the charter and plan of the last full plan (`real_base`, `real["plan"]`), so a
  revert diffs to nothing. A revision is named "<name> (change k)" so a build revision's dependency waits for the doc
  revision, not the original of the same name; a file workflow's revision keeps `revises`. The validator refuses other
  workflows until every row of the change plan is registered (then fixes after Audit go through as usual). A rule or
  standard change with no item change is re-planned in full and Identity tells the Requester why. An edit (remove +
  add) also revises every planning doc that informed the removed number (j2_change step 5). In a full re-plan the
  new plan's workflows build new sections beside the old ones (check in a real run).

### Task 8: Relay from revised docs

- [x] After a doc revision is built: `direct_readers` not already in the change plan → one "affected? what?" call
      each; affected → revision registered; walk in `relay_waves` order; stop at "no"; unreadable after one retry →
      affected.
- [x] Tests: How to play reached through Product plan; garbled reply → revised; "no" stops the walk. Commit.
- Notes: the relay runs when Coordination takes the turn after a doc revision of the open change is built
  (`_change_relay`); readers are asked once each (`change.json` "relay"), documents in `relay_waves` order. An affected
  reader's revision is registered by code (its atom, outputs and cost, the revised doc in its dependencies). A revision
  refused for the budget is posted and the walk goes on (no budget question yet). Tests use the mock plan with a second
  doc (Design reads Plan; Build item 1 reads only Design).

### Task 9: Record, docs and real runs

- [ ] `change.json` (append-only) and a "Changes" section in `report.md`.
- [ ] Publish the framework on the Adaptation page of the native docs (location to confirm).
- [ ] Real Sudoku run, then the 11 prompts one at a time with `J2_CHANGE=1`; record decision, docs, workflows,
      calls, credits and minutes per prompt in `docs/charter-change-results.md`. Turn `J2_CHANGE` on by default only
      if the routes match or each difference is explained.
