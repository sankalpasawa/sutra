"""J2: the five functions run one department until Identity's goal is met (Native docs, system/department).
The flow follows the J2 diagram (docs/j2-flow.jpg):

  J2.a  Identity reads the Requester's brief: enough information to work? If not, it asks the Requester specific
        questions and the run waits; it asks as many rounds as it needs, then records the charter. It invents
        nothing. A fact the Requester can't supply yet is recorded as "to be confirmed" against its done-when item.
  J2.b  Adaptation proposes workflows (or disputes an Audit finding or a Coordination HOLD), using the most
        relevant lessons from earlier runs (memory/lessons.jsonl)
  J2.c  Priority prices the proposal: GRANT, COUNTER or REFUSE. The bargain is bounded by four hops, fifteen
        minutes and its spend (AI calls); past any of them it goes to Identity
  J2.d  Any two agents that disagree get 4 attempts to settle it themselves; then Identity resolves it from the
        charter, or, if the charter doesn't decide it, asks the Requester one decision-ready question and rules
  J2.e  Validator (plain code) checks and registers the agreed workflows; each one gets its own workflow agent
        ("W-1 Builder") that owns one marked section of the site file
  J2.f  Coordination schedules; Priority checks each run's envelope; the workflow's agent writes its section,
        retries within its envelope and reports back to Coordination
  J2.g  Audit checks the result against the charter's done-when list and files its findings to Identity. A
        missing fact only the Requester knows becomes Identity's question to the Requester
  J2.h  Identity: is the site workable (see workable())? Yes: Identity tells the Requester the goal is reached.
        No: back to J2.b. When Audit confirms a fix worked, Adaptation saves a lesson

Only Identity talks to the Requester: any other agent that addresses the Requester is redirected to Identity.
Each function's instructions come from agents/j2/team.md + agents/j2/<function>.md, read fresh on every call.
Speaking order is dynamic: every reply names "next", and code allows only the routes in ROUTES (an illegal pick
is redirected with a "Route check" note). Code also enforces the limits: 4 attempts per disagreement, budget,
max cycles, max turns per cycle and the same failure twice in a row. A limit never stops the run silently:
Identity asks the Requester to add budget, drop the failing items or ship as is. A run that waits on the
Requester stops and resumes on the reply, so it can't loop on its own.

J2_FIXES (default 0) picks the mode, so findings can compare the two:
  0  baseline, as close to the diagram as possible: an Identity ruling goes straight to the validator (J2.d ->
     J2.e), and a change request after done goes straight to Adaptation (J2.b).
  1  fixes: (a) an Identity ruling that costs more than Priority granted goes back to Priority (J2.c) once for
     pricing; Priority's answer is final, and if the ruling is still over budget Identity asks the Requester.
     (b) a change request after done goes to Identity at J2.a first, then J2.b.
